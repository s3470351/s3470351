									<p>The project idea that I am planning to come up with is a smartphone app that will help users with accounting issues. As I am looking into go into the e-commerce sector, I have decided to come up with a business oriented smartphone app. The main purpose of developing this app is to help people that run businesses or people that work in the accounting field to have a easily accessible smartphone app that can help them keep them organised as well as being able to track their personal or the business’s spending.</p>

<p>I believe that this smartphone app will be useful because of the importance of accounting in today’s business field. I believe that my smartphone app will allow people to access accounting information easily. Currently, there are accounting softwares such as Xero, which has many users and I believe that my smartphone app will be able to offer consumers a new smartphone app to trial. I would want to cater my smartphone app to people that run small businesses as I believe it will provide a convenient service to them. In Australia, there is huge number of businesses that are considered as a small business entity.</p>

<p>I plan to develop my smartphone app by using the App Inventor for Android, which is now maintained by MIT. This will be good platform for me to create my smartphone app as it caters to newcomers to computer programming. The main idea of my app is to provide users with the basic accounting tools that will help them to better manage their business. For example, users will be able to check their business’s cash flow which can help to make better decisions about their business. Besides that, my app will cater to users of different business types. For example, my smartphone app will be able to cater to people that work in the agriculture sector, property sector, e-commerce, retail sector and etc. I believe that the flexibility of the app will be a key aspect that will be able to attract customers. Among the main features of the app is the invoicing feature. This feature allows the users to create invoices that can help them to bill their clients quicker. Besides that, the users are able to customise their invoices. We will also provide a few professional invoice templates which will help first time users to easily create their invoices. The second feature of the app is allowing the user to check their business inventory. This is will allow the user to instantly be able to access and review their inventory. This will provide a quick and easy way to track the amount of inventory left. Besides that, the user will be able to see which products are selling better than others. The next feature of the app allows users to pay their employees with ease. This can help to save time and allow the user to focus on other areas of their business. The user will be able to track and check their employee’s working hours as well as have receiving notifications to pay their employees. This will reduce the risks of paying the employees late. Besides that, I also plan to cover issues such as superannuation with the app that will make it easier for the user. Besides that, my app will allow the users to make purchase orders easier by having purchase order templates for them to choose. This will save time as the users can just modify the templates provided to place their purchase orders. Finally, the app will allow the users to track their expenses and earnings. I believe that this is a very important aspect because the user will be able to track their business’s cash position at anytime. This will ensure that the users will not encounter any unexpected costs as they will be able to track all their expenses by using the app.</p>

<p>The software that will be required to create my smartphone app is the App Inventor for Android. This will be the main programme used to develop my smartphone app. Besides that, it will also be important to understand Java. Besides that, I will also need to invest in a computer to be able to maintain my app and ensure that it is running smoothly. I plan to learn majority of the software language required to develop the app. However, I also plan to employ someone that will be able to assist me in developing and maintaining the app.</p>

<p>Finally, the outcome that I would expect if the app is successful is that it will be able to compete with softwares such as Xero. Besides that, I also hope that I would be able to expand my app presence and develop my app for Apple App Store. I believe that if my app was out in both the Apple App Store as well as the Android Store, I would be able to reach a huge number of consumers. I hope that my app will be able to help people that are not familiar with accounting better manage their businesses. I also hope that my app will be able to provide them a easily understandable service to help manage their business. I hope that my app will be able to help small businesses as small businesses make up a huge number of businesses here in Australia. In the future, I hope that my app will be a globally successful app that will even be used by big businesses and corporations.</p>
